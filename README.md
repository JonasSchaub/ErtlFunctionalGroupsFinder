# ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder
ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder for CDK

The Ertl algorithm for automated functional groups detection and extraction of organic molecules is implemented on the basis of the [Chemistry Development Kit (CDK)](https://cdk.github.io/).

Folder **Basic** contains the basic ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder code and test code for integration in Java projects (see instructions in *Basic usage instructions.txt*).

Folder **CDK** contains CDK library jar file *cdk-2.2.jar* that ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder works with.

Folder **Evaluation** contains sample code for evaluation of functional groups with ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder (see instructions in *Evaluation usage instructions.txt*).

Folder **Performance** contains a jar library for performance tests (see instructions in *Performance usage instructions.txt*).

ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder is currently under scientific review - more detailed information will be available soon.
