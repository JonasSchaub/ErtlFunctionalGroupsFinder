Performance usage instructions with Java 1.8 (or higher)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install Java 1.8 (or higher) on your machine (if necessary)
2. Copy content of sub-folder "jar" to a destination directory on your 
   machine with read/write access.
3. Copy SD-file with your molecule library to the destination directory on your 
   machine (you may use "ChEBI_lite_3star_subset.sdf" as a (small) test library).

To run a performance test from the command line, go to the destination directory 
on your machine and type:
java -jar "ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinderPerformanceTest.jar" "sdFileName" numberOfThreads
sdFilePathname : Name of the SD-file with your molecule library to test (must be 
                 located in the same directory as 
                 "ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinderPerformanceTest.jar")
numberOfThreads: Number of parallel calculation threads (>= 1)
You may wish to add additional JVM parameters in the command line (e.g. for 
increased heap size to avoid an "out of memory" exception for large SD-files).

Note: Sub-directory "src" contains the Java source code for 
"ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinderPerformanceTest.jar".
