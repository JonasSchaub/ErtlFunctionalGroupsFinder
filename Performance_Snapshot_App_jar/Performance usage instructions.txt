Performance usage instructions with Java 11 (or higher)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install Java 11 (or higher) on your machine (if necessary)
2. Copy the content of this sub-folder to a destination directory on your 
   machine with read/write access.
3. Copy SD-file with your molecule library to the destination directory on your 
   machine (you may use "ChEBI_lite_3star_subset.sdf" as a (small) test library).

To run a performance test from the command line, go to the destination directory 
on your machine and type:

java -jar "ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder-PerformanceSnapshotApp-1.2.1.0.jar" "sdFileName" numberOfThreads

sdFilePathname : Name of the SD-file with your molecule library to test (must be 
                 located in the same directory as 
                 "ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder-PerformanceSnapshotApp-1.2.1.0.jar")
numberOfThreads: Number of parallel calculation threads (>= 1)

You may wish to add additional JVM parameters in the command line (e.g. for 
increased heap size to avoid an "out of memory" exception for large SD-files).

Note: Sub-directory "src" contains the Java source code for 
"ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder-PerformanceSnapshotApp-1.2.1.0.jar".
